Sure, I can help you implement the `sortWaitList()` function. Here’s how you can do it:

```cpp
void sortWaitList()
{
    if (isEmpty())
    {
        return;
    }

    // Step 1: Find the customer with the highest absolute value of energy
    Customer *maxEnergyCustomer = front;
    Customer *curr = (Customer *)front->next;
    do
    {
        if (abs(curr->energy) > abs(maxEnergyCustomer->energy) || 
            (abs(curr->energy) == abs(maxEnergyCustomer->energy) && curr->timer < maxEnergyCustomer->timer))
        {
            maxEnergyCustomer = curr;
        }
        curr = (Customer *)curr->next;
    } while (curr != front);

    // Step 2: Shell Sort
    for (int gap = count / 2; gap > 0; gap /= 2)
    {
        for (int i = gap; i < count; i++)
        {
            Customer *temp = getCustomer(i);
            int tempEnergy = temp->energy;
            int j;
            for (j = i; j >= gap && getCustomer(j - gap)->energy < tempEnergy; j -= gap)
            {
                swapCustomers(j, j - gap);
            }
            getCustomer(j)->energy = tempEnergy;
        }
    }
}

// Helper function to get the customer at a specific index
Customer* getCustomer(int index)
{
    Customer *curr = front;
    for (int i = 0; i < index; i++)
    {
        curr = (Customer *)curr->next;
    }
    return curr;
}

// Helper function to swap two customers
void swapCustomers(int i, int j)
{
    Customer *customerI = getCustomer(i);
    Customer *customerJ = getCustomer(j);
  
    int tempEnergy = customerI->energy;
    string tempName = customerI->name;
    int tempTimer = customerI->timer;

    customerI->energy = customerJ->energy;
    customerI->name = customerJ->name;
    customerI->timer = customerJ->timer;

    customerJ->energy = tempEnergy;
    customerJ->name = tempName;
    customerJ->timer = tempTimer;
}
```

This code first finds the customer with the highest absolute value of energy. Then it uses Shell Sort to sort the queue from that customer up to the front. The helper functions `getCustomer()` and `swapCustomers()` are used to access and swap customers at specific indices in the queue. Please note that this code assumes that the `timer` field in the `Customer` class is unique for each customer and that it is used as a tie-breaker when two customers have the same energy.

You’re correct. The gap in Shell Sort should be calculated based on the position in the queue. Here’s the corrected code:

```cpp
void sortWaitList()
{
    if (isEmpty())
    {
        return;
    }

    // Step 1: Find the customer with the highest absolute value of energy
    Customer *maxEnergyCustomer = front;
    Customer *curr = (Customer *)front->next;
    do
    {
        if (abs(curr->energy) > abs(maxEnergyCustomer->energy) || 
            (abs(curr->energy) == abs(maxEnergyCustomer->energy) && curr->timer < maxEnergyCustomer->timer))
        {
            maxEnergyCustomer = curr;
        }
        curr = (Customer *)curr->next;
    } while (curr != front);

    // Step 2: Shell Sort
    int position = getPosition(maxEnergyCustomer);
    for (int gap = position / 2; gap > 0; gap /= 2)
    {
        for (int i = gap; i < position; i++)
        {
            Customer *temp = getCustomer(i);
            int tempEnergy = temp->energy;
            int j;
            for (j = i; j >= gap && getCustomer(j - gap)->energy < tempEnergy; j -= gap)
            {
                swapCustomers(j, j - gap);
            }
            getCustomer(j)->energy = tempEnergy;
        }
    }
}

// Helper function to get the position of a customer in the queue
int getPosition(Customer *customer)
{
    Customer *curr = front;
    int position = 0;
    do
    {
        if (curr == customer)
        {
            return position;
        }
        curr = (Customer *)curr->next;
        position++;
    } while (curr != front);

    return -1; // Return -1 if the customer is not found in the queue
}
```

This code first finds the customer with the highest absolute value of energy. Then it uses Shell Sort to sort the queue from that customer up to the front. The helper functions `getCustomer()`, `swapCustomers()`, and `getPosition()` are used to access, swap, and find the position of customers in the queue. Please note that this code assumes that the `timer` field in the `Customer` class is unique for each customer and that it is used as a tie-breaker when two customers have the same energy.
